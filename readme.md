FAQs

1. Why not support Win32? 

-- Why don't you switch to a decent hardware before doing bioinformatics?

2. How to compile?

-- for Mrbayes, I compiled it with mingw64-gcc and git bash. you may run gmake directly at /src folder. 
-- Others are compiled with MSYS2 mingw64.
-- for MPI compilation, please install msmpi (and its SDK) first.
